Winsock for VBScript is a component (wrapper) which helps to overcome Mswinsck.ocx licensing issue. 
Generally this Microsoft control cannot be used in VBScript unless you have a Visual Studio or 
other appropriate design application installed on your PC or have this control licensed. 
Once you download and register WinsckW.ocx you may freely use all methods and properties of 
Mswinsck.ocx within your VBScript or HTML.

Note: Both Mswinsck.ocx and WinsckW.ocx must be registered on your PC.

==============================================================================
All Methods, Properties, Constants and Events in WinsckW.ocx are identical those standard Mswinsck.ocx 
have available except binding object and closing connection.

	Create Object:

		Set objWS = CreateObject("WinsckW.WinSock")

	To capture events in VBscript:
	
		Set objWS = WScript.CreateObject("WinsckW.WinSock", "objWS_")

	In IE implementation of VBscript within HTML:
	
		<object classid="clsid:B277FEC2-203A-473F-B98B-17181ED5F4A9"  codeBase="WinsckW.ocx" 
		id="objWS" events="True" width="57" height="59">
		</object>

	Close Connection:

		objWS.CloseCon

In addition to standard wrapped properties, WinsckW.ocx includes base64 encode/decode module 
for Basic SMTP authentication

To encode use:

	stringEncoded = objWS.encode("string_to_encode")

To decode use:

	stringDecoded = objWS.decode("string_to_decode")
==============================================================================

Included few samples for sending Emails, simple client\server communicator and
Peer-to-Peer simple HTML chat (IE Browser Only).

All samples are only intended to display the way to use winsock in VBscript.


Chat is configured to run both "WS_client.htm" and "WS_server.htm" on local machine. 
To run it on 2 different machines, replace "localhost" with the name of the machine 
you run "WS_client.htm" from.


To start chat: Run both pages, Click " Listen" on server, then "Connect" on the client.
